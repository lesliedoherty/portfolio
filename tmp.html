                It was wonderful to experience Leslie as Director of Marketing at Ellislab, as well as community liason.  She would actively participate in conversations with the software's user base, listening, asking questions, and offering a friendly voice to the company.  I looked forward to her round-up posts each week highlighting community news and new developments within the company.  I recommend Leslie as someone who is easy to get along with, fun to have around, and truly knows what she is doing in regards to web design, development, copywriting, and marketing.

                While I do consider Leslie a personal friend, I've hired her for both professional and personal websites and blogs.  She's instrumental in aspects I know nothing about, and instructive on those things I can do myself.  Incredibly helpful, but also fun to work with.
